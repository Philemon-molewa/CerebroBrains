AI project for Business Analysis 3.2
Uniply is an AI application assistant built to help applicants during university online applications. The AI simplifies the application process by allowing applicants to enter their matric results, and the AI will filter the relevant courses the applicant qualifies for based on their results. The AI will also make bursary suggestions for some of the course that are funded by that bursary. We are building this AI for the Vaal University of Technology. In simple terms we can say that Uniply is an automated university prospectus.
